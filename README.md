The script does the following. More coding details and step-by-step explanations are commented in the R script file.

# Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

# Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

# From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
